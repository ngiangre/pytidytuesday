# pytidytuesday

A repository for exploring and performing python analyses based on `https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday`.

# Structure

This repository uses renv to set up the project environment (since I use Quarto to write python, it was easier to use renv to set the virtual environment) and the *.Rproj file sets the project working directory (I am using Rstudio as my IDE on Posit Cloud).

Each analysis has its own folder with a Quarto document for a tidytuesday week period. Any figures or outputs created go into the same folder and is prefixed by the name of the document from which it came from.
